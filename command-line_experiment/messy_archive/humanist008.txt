As an addendum to my earlier note about Abagail Young's query,
CCAT has now received a copy of the MicroSoft DOS extension to
permit the CD-ROM reader to be accessed as though it were just
another disk drive on the IBM machine. We have been successful
in reading the new TLG CD-ROM in this manner, which bodes well
for future software development on such large bodies of material.
Our present configuration is as follows:
Sony CD-ROM reader with interface/controller card for IBM PC,
Device Driver for the IBM (from Sony or from Discovery Systems),
MS DOS extension licensed for $10 per drive through
Discovery Systems, 7001 Discovery Blvd, Dublin OHIO 43017
(tel 614-761-2000). [There are other vendors similarly licensed,
I am sure. Discovery Systems was most convenient for us.]
 
Now, with the proof that the new TLG CD-ROM format can be
accessed with off the shelf products, CCAT will focus on
the search and retrieval software to increase efficiency on
the DOS machines, and on quality control of data to be
included on CCAT CD-ROM productions. Some of the current
developments will be displayed at the combined annual meetings of
the American Academy of Religion and Society of Biblical
Literature and American Schools of Oriental Research in Boston
on 5-8 December 1987. Cooperation and other sorts of input
are encouraged.
