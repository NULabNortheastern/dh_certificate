    "Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, `2 \\* (3-1)` is `4`, and `(1+1)\\*\\*(5-2)` is `8`. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn't change the result.\n",

    "\n",
    "Multiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So `2\\*3-1` is `5`, not `4`, and `6+4/2` is `8.0`, not `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. So the expression `5-3-1` is `1`, not `3`, because the `5-3` happens first and then `1` is subtracted from `2`.\n",
