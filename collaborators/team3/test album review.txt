hello! Did you know that Evanescence released a new album in 2021? I did not! It does not have the same level 
of teen angst and dramatic suffering that characterized Amy Lee's deput, 
but it is still a solid piece of work that shows how the band has matured over the last 20 years. 
Highly recommend for all the tragic former goth kids.
