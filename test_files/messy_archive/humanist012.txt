My area of literary specialization is the English Renaissance.
For my research interests in computer applications to literary
studies, see the biography of my colleague David Barnard. For
1986-87, I have been chairman of the Steering Group for
Humanities Computing of five Ontario universities: McMaster,
Queen's, Toronto, Waterloo, and Western Ontario. I am also a
member of the steering group of the Ontario Consortium for
Computing and the Humanities.
