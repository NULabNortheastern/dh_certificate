I'd appreciate a little information:  I've been talking to
someone here at U of T who wishes to produce a document with
Western European language text mixed with Sanskrit (written
with the Davanagari script).  I believe they want Telugu
and Tamil as well.  They will be using an IBM PC.
 
Does anyone out there have a happy experience with any software
and hardware for an IBM PC that will support this?  We haven't
been able to lay our hands on a definitive list of languages
and character sets that Nota Bene will be supporting.  What other
choices are there?
 
I'd appreciate a reply directed to me, but will summarize for
HUMANIST, if there is general interest.
