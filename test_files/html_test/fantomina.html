       where, though there were a great Number of celebrated <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Toasts</tei-rs>, she perceived several <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person" ana="#class-upper">Gentlemen</tei-rs> extremely pleased 
         themselves with entertaining a <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-lower"><tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Woman</tei-rs> who sat in a Corner of the <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place" xml:id="pit1" id="pit1" corresp="#notepit1">Pit</tei-rs>, and, by her Air and Manner of receiving them, 
       might easily be known to be one of those who come there for no other Purpose, than to create Acquaintance with as
       many as seem <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">desirous</tei-seg> of it.</tei-seg> She could not help testifying her <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">Contempt</tei-seg> of <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Men</tei-rs>, who, regardless either of the Play, 
       or Circle, threw away their Time in such a Manner, to some <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Ladies</tei-rs> that sat by her: But they, either <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">less surprised</tei-seg> 
       by being more accustomed to such Sights, than she who had been bred for the most Part in the Country, or not of a 
       Disposition to consider any Thing very deeply, took but little Notice of it. She still thought of it, however; and 
       the longer she reflected on it, the greater was her <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#curiosity">Wonder</tei-seg>, that <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Men</tei-rs>, some of whom she knew were accounted to have Wit, should have Tastes so

       very <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">Depraved</tei-seg>. &#8211; This excited a <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#curiosity">Curiosity</tei-seg> in her to know in what Manner these Creatures were address'd:&#8211; She was 
       young, a Stranger to the World, and consequently to the Dangers of it; and having no Body in Town, at that Time, 
       to whom she was oblig'd to be accountable for her Actions, did in every Thing as her Inclinations or Humours render'd 
       most <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">agreeable</tei-seg> to her: Therefore thought it not in the least a Fault to put in practice a little Whim which came
       immediately into her Head, to <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">dress herself</tei-seg> as near as she could in the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-lower">Fashion of those Women who make sale of their
       Favours</tei-seg>, and set herself in the Way of being accosted as such a one, having at that Time no other Aim, than the 
       Gratification of an <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#curiosity">innocent Curiosity</tei-seg>.&#8212; She had no sooner design'd this Frolick, than she put it in Execution; and 
       <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">muffling her Hoods over her Face, went the next Night into the <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place">Gallery-Box</tei-rs>, and practising as much as she had observ'd,
       at that Distance, the Behaviour of that <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Woman</tei-rs>, was not long before she found her <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">Disguise</tei-seg> had answer'd the Ends she wore
       it for:</tei-seg> &#8211; <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-upper"> A Crowd of Purchasers of all Degrees and Capacities were in a Moment gather'd about her, each endeavouring 
       to out-bid the other, in offering her a Price for her Embraces</tei-seg>. &#8211; She listen'd to 'em all, and was <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">not a little diverted</tei-seg>
       in her Mind at the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">Disappointment</tei-seg> she shou'd give to so many, each of which thought himself secure of gaining her. &#8211; 
       She was told by 'em all, that she was the <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person" ana="#gender">most lovely Woman in the World</tei-rs>; and some cry'd, 
       <tei-said data-origname="said" style="font-style: italic">Gad, she is mighty like my fine 
       <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person" ana="#class-upper">Lady Such-a-one</tei-rs>,</tei-said> &#8211; naming <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">her own Name</tei-rs>. 
       She was <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">naturally vain</tei-seg>, and receiv'd <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">no small Pleasure</tei-seg> in hearing herself prais'd,
       <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">tho' in the Person of another</tei-seg>, and a <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="deception">suppos'd</tei-seg> <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person" ana="#class-lower">Prostitute</tei-rs>; but she dispatch'd as soon as she cou'd all that had hitherto 
       attack'd her, when she saw the accomplish'd <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style: italic">Beauplaisir</tei-persName> 
       was making his Way thro' the Crowd as fast as he was able, to 
       reach the Bench she sat on. She had often seen him in the <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place">Drawing-Room</tei-rs>, had talk'd with him; but then her <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-upper">Quality</tei-seg> and reputed
       <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#gender">Virtue kept him from using her with that Freedom she now expected he wou'd</tei-seg>
  
       <tei-pb data-origname="pb" data-empty=""></tei-pb>
       <tei-fw data-origname="fw" type="pageNum">259</tei-fw>
       do, and had discover'd something in him, which had made her often think <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">she shou'd not be displeas'd</tei-seg>, if he wou'd abate 
       some Part of his <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">Reserve</tei-seg>. &#8211; Now was the Time to have her Wishes answer'd: &#8211; He look'd in her Face, and fancy'd, as many 
       others had done, that she <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">very much resembled</tei-seg> that <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Lady</tei-rs> whom she really was; but <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">the vast Disparity there appear'd between
       their Characters, prevented him from entertaining even the most distant Thought that they cou'd be the same</tei-seg>. &#8211; He address'd
       her at first with the usual Salutations of her <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">pretended Profession</tei-seg>, as, <tei-said data-origname="said" style="font-style: italic">Are you engag'd, <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Madam</tei-rs>?  
       &#8211; Will you permit me to wait on you home after the Play? &#8211; By Heaven, you are a fine <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Girl</tei-rs>! &#8211; How long have you us'd this <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place">House?</tei-rs></tei-said> &#8211; And such like Questions; 
       but perceiving she had a Turn of Wit, and a <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-upper">genteel Manner</tei-seg> in her Raillery, beyond what is frequently to be found among those 
       <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-lower">Wretches</tei-seg>, who are for the most part <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-upper">Gentlewomen</tei-seg> <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-lower">but by Necessity</tei-seg>, few of 'em having had an Education suitable to what they <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">affect 
       to appear</tei-seg>, he chang'd the Form of his Conversation, and shew'd her it was not because he understood no better, that he had made
       use of Expressions so little polite. &#8211; In fine, they were <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">infinitely charm'd</tei-seg> with each other: He was <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">transported</tei-seg> to find so much
       Beauty and Wit in a <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Woman</tei-rs>, who he doubted not but on very easy Terms he might <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">enjoy</tei-seg>; and she found a vast deal of <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Pleasure</tei-seg> in 
       conversing with him in this free and unrestrain'd Manner. They pass'd their Time all the Play with an equal <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Satisfaction</tei-seg>; but
       when it was over, she found herself involv'd in a <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#fear">Difficulty</tei-seg>, which before never enter'd into her Head, but which she knew not 
       well how to get over. &#8211; The <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Passion</tei-seg> he profess'd for her, was not of that humble Nature which can be content with <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">distant
       Adorations</tei-seg>: &#8211; He resolv'd not to part from her without the Gratifications of those <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Desires</tei-seg> she had inspir'd; and presuming on the 
       Liberties which her <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">suppos'd</tei-seg> Function allow'd off, told her she must either go with him to some convenient <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place">House</tei-rs> of his procuring,
       or permit him to wait on her to her own

       <tei-fw data-origname="fw" type="pageNum">260</tei-fw>
       <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place">Lodgings</tei-rs>. &#8211; Never had she been in such a <tei-hi data-origname="hi" style="font-style: italic">Dilemma</tei-hi>: 
       Three or four Times did she open her Mouth to confess her real <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-upper">Quality</tei-seg>; but 
       the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" xml:id="fate1" id="fate1" corresp="#notefate1">influence of her ill Stars</tei-seg> prevented it, by putting an Excuse into her Head, which did the Business as well, and at the same 
       Time did not take from her the Power of seeing and entertaining him a second Time with the same Freedom she had done this. &#8211; She told him, 
       she was under Obligations to a <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Man</tei-rs> who maintain'd her, and whom she durst not disappoint, having promis'd to meet him that Night at a <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place">House</tei-rs> 
       hard by. &#8211; This Story so like what those <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Ladies</tei-rs> sometimes tell, was not at all suspected by <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style: italic">Beauplaisir</tei-persName>; and assuring her he wou'd be far 
       from doing her a Prejudice, desir'd that in return for the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness">Pain</tei-seg> he shou'd suffer in being depriv'd of her Company that Night, that she wou'd 
       order her Affairs, so as not to render him <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness">unhappy</tei-seg> the next. She gave a solemn Promise to be in the same <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place">Box</tei-rs> on the Morrow Evening; and they
       took Leave of each other; he to the <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place">Tavern</tei-rs> to drown the Remembrance of his <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness">Disappointment</tei-seg>; she in a Hackney-Chair hurry'd home to indulge 
       <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Contemplation on the Frolick</tei-seg> she had taken, designing nothing less on her first Reflections, than to keep the Promise she had made him, and 
       hugging herself with <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Joy</tei-seg>, that she had the good Luck to come off <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">undiscover'd</tei-seg>. 
     </tei-p>
      <tei-p data-origname="p">
        But these Cogitations were but of a short Continuance, they vanish'd with the Hurry of her Spirits, and were succeeded by others vastly 
        different and ruinous: &#8211; All the Charms of <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style:italic">Beauplaisir</tei-persName> came fresh into her Mind; <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">she languish'd, she almost dy'd for another Opportunity of 
        conversing with him; and not all the Admonitions of her Discretion were effectual to oblige her to deny laying hold of that which offer'd
        itself the next Night.</tei-seg> &#8211; She depended on the Strength of her Virtue, to bear her fate thro' Tryals more dangerous than she apprehended 
        this to be, and never having been address'd by him as <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Lady</tei-rs>, &#8212; was resolv'd to receive his Devoirs as a <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Town-Mistress</tei-rs>, imagining a world of
        <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Satisfaction</tei-seg> to herself in engaging him in the Cha-

If she had ever been in Love? and many other such Questions, befitting one of the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-lower">Degree</tei-seg> she <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception"> appear'd to be</tei-seg>: All which she answer'd with such <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception"> seeming Innocence</tei-seg>, as more <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire"> enflam'd the amorous Heart</tei-seg> of him who talk'd to her. He compelled her to sit in his Lap; and gazing on her blushing Beauties, which, if possible, receiv'd Addition from <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-lower">her plain and rural Dress</tei-seg>, he soon lost the Power of containing himself. &#8211; His wild Desires burst out in all his Words and Actions: he call'd her little Angel, Cherubim, swore he must enjoy her, <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">though Death were to be the Consequence, devour'd her Lips, her Breasts with greedy Kisses, held to his burning Bosom her half-yielding, half-reluctant Body, nor suffered her to get loose,</tei-seg>

      <tei-p data-origname="p">His Stay at <tei-placeName data-origname="placeName" style="font-style: italic">Bath</tei-placeName> exceeded not a Month; but in that Time his <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception"> suppos'd Country Lass</tei-seg> <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire"> had persecuted him so much with her Fondness</tei-seg>, that in spite of the Eagerness with which he first enjoy'd her, <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion"> he was at last grown more weary of her, than he had been of <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style: italic">Fantomina</tei-persName></tei-seg>; which she perceiving, would not be troublesome, but quitting her Service, remained privately in the Town till she heard he was on his Return; and in that Time provided herself of <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">another Disguise to carry on a third Plot</tei-seg>, which her inventing Brain had furnished her with, once more to renew his twice-decay'd Ardours. <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#class-upper">The Dress she had order'd to be made</tei-seg>, was such as Widows wear in their first <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness"> Mourning</tei-seg>, which, together with the most afflicted and penitential Countenance that ever was seen, was no small Alteration to her who us'd to seem all Gaiety. &#8211; To add to this, her Hair, which she was accustom'd to wear very loose, <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">both when <tei-name data-origname="name">Fantomina</tei-name> and <tei-name data-origname="name">Celia</tei-name></tei-seg>, was now ty'd back so straight, and her Pinners coming so very forward, that there was none of it to be seen.

the greatest <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">Modesty</tei-seg> and <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">Respect</tei-seg>, he turned the Conversation, as
        though without Design, on that <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Joy</tei-seg>-giving <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Passion</tei-seg>, and soon discover'd that was indeed the Subject she was best <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">pleas'd</tei-seg> to be entertained with; for on his giving her a Hint to
        begin upon, never any Tongue run more voluble than hers, on the prodigious Power it had to
        influence the Souls of those posses'd of it, to Actions even the most distant from their
        Intentions, Principles, or Humours. &#8211; From that she pass'd to a Description of the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Happiness</tei-seg> of mutual <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Affection</tei-seg>; &#8211; the
        unspeakable <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Extasy</tei-seg> of those who meet with equal <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Ardency</tei-seg>; and represented it in Colours so lively, and disclos'd by the Gestures
        with which her Words were accompany'd, and the Accent of her Voice so true a Feeling of what
        she said, that <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style:italic">Beauplaisir</tei-persName>,
        without being as stupid, as he was really the contrary, could not avoid perceiving there
        were Seeds of Fire, not yet extinguish'd, in this fair <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Widow's</tei-rs> Soul,
        which wanted but the kindling Breath of tender <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness">Sighs</tei-seg> to light into
        a Blaze. &#8211; He now thought himself as fortunate, as some Moments before he had the Reverse;
        and doubted not, but, that before they parted, he should find a Way to dry the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness">Tears</tei-seg> of this lovely <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person" ana="#sadness">Mourner</tei-rs>,
        to the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Satisfaction</tei-seg> of them both. He did not, however, offer, as
        he had done to <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style:italic">Fantomina</tei-persName> and
        <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style:italic">Celia</tei-persName>, to urge his <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Passion</tei-seg> directly to her, but by a thousand little softning Artifices,
        which he well knew how to use, gave her leave to guess he was enamour'd. When they came to
        the Inn where they were to lie, he declar'd himself somewhat more freely, and perceiving she
        did not <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">resent</tei-seg> it past Forgiveness, grew more encroaching still: &#8211;
        He now took the Liberty of kissing away her <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness">Tears</tei-seg>, and catching
        the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness">Sighs</tei-seg> as they issued from her Lips; telling her if <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness">Grief</tei-seg> was infectious, he was resolv'd to have his Share; protesting
        he would <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">gladly</tei-seg> exchange <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Passions</tei-seg> with
        her, and be <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">content</tei-seg> to bear her Load of <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#sadness"><tei-emph data-origname="emph" style="font-style:italic">Sorrow</tei-emph></tei-seg>, if she would as willingly ease the
        Burden of his <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire"><tei-emph data-origname="emph" style="font-style:italic">Love</tei-emph></tei-seg>. &#8211; She
        said little in answer to the strenuous Pressures with which at last he <tei-pb data-origname="pb" data-empty=""></tei-pb>
        <tei-fw data-origname="fw" type="pageNum">274</tei-fw> ventur'd to enfold her, but not thinking it Decent, for the
        Character she had assum'd, to yield so suddenly, and unable to deny both his and her own
        Inclinations, she counterfeited a fainting, and fell motionless upon his Breast. &#8211; He had no
        great Notion that she was in a real Fit, and the Room they supp'd in happening to have a Bed
        in it, he took her in his Arms and laid her on it, believing, that whatever her <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#anger">Distemper</tei-seg> was, that was the most proper Place to convey her to. &#8211; He
        laid himself down by her, and endeavour'd to bring her to herself; and she was too <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#emotion">grateful</tei-seg> to her kind <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person">Physician</tei-rs> at her
        returning Sense, to remove from the Posture he had put her in, without his Leave. </tei-p>
      <tei-p data-origname="p"> IT may, perhaps, seem strange that <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style:italic">Beauplaisir</tei-persName> should in such near <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Intimacies</tei-seg>
        continue still <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">deceiv'd</tei-seg>: I know there are Men who will swear it

        knowing a Woman they had once <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">enjoy'd</tei-seg>. In answer to these Scruples,
        I can only say, that besides the Alteration which the <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#deception">Change of Dress
          made in her, she was so admirably skill'd in the Art of feigning, that she had the Power
          of putting on almost what Face she <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">pleas'd</tei-seg>, and knew so exactly
          how to form her Behaviour to the Character she represented, that all the Comedians at both
          <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="place">Playhouses</tei-rs> are infinitely short of her Performances: She could
          vary her very Glances, tune her Voice to Accents the most different imaginable from those
          in which she spoke when she appear'd herself. &#8211; These Aids from Nature, join'd to the
          Wiles of Art, and the Distance between the Places where the imagin'd <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style:italic">Fantomina</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname="persName" style="font-style:italic">Celia</tei-persName> were, might very well prevent his
          having any Thought that they were the same, or that the fair <tei-rs data-origname="rs" type="person" style="font-style:italic">Widow</tei-rs> was either of them</tei-seg>: It never
        so much as enter'd his Head, and though he did <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">fancy</tei-seg> he observed in
        the Face of the latter, Features which were not altogether unknown to him, yet he could not
        recollect when or where he had known them; &#8211; and being told by her, that from her Birth, she
        had never <tei-pb data-origname="pb" data-empty=""></tei-pb>
        <tei-fw data-origname="fw" type="pageNum">275</tei-fw> remov'd from <tei-placeName data-origname="placeName" style="font-style:italic">Bristol</tei-placeName>, a Place where he never was, he rejected the Belief of
        having seen her, and suppos'd his Mind had been deluded by an Idea of some other, whom she
        might have a Resemblance of. </tei-p>
      <tei-p data-origname="p"> THEY pass'd the Time of their Journey in as much <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Happiness</tei-seg> as
        the most luxurious <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#happiness">Gratification</tei-seg> of wild <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">Desires</tei-seg> could make them; and when they came to the End of it, <tei-seg data-origname="seg" ana="#desire">parted not without a mutual Promise of seeing each other often</tei-seg>. &#8211; He told her to

        <tei-noteGrp data-origname="noteGrp"> 
          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#box1" xml:id="notebox1" id="notebox1">Wealthier theatregoers sat in private or semi-private boxes, where they had the best view of the play and were most easily visible to other theatregoers</tei-note>
          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#pit1" xml:id="notepit1" id="notepit1">Standing-room only, the cheapest place to be in the theatre, often quite rowdy. Men stood here, women in the pit were generally sex workers or sometimes sellers of food or drink.</tei-note>
          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#fate1" xml:id="notefate1" id="notefate1">This is one of several places where the text inserts some reference to an external force prompting the protagonist to behave in a specific way. In a story that is otherwise focused on a young woman rather impropbably controlling her own life, it's interesting that at this key point, it is the external influence of "ill Stars" that causes the Young Lady not to confess everything and end the deception right there. Other key moments where this happens includes her first sexual encounter with Beauplasir (when he insists) and when she chooses to continuing pursuing him after he leaves her Celia character.</tei-note>

          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#gender1a" xml:id="notegender1a" id="notegender1a">Fantomina seems to be commenting that women are inclined to believe Man, something she deems as foolish, and it is their way, or duty, to do this. This provides insight to the "duty" of women at the time.</tei-note>
          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#Illusion" xml:id="noteIllusion" id="noteIllusion">Fantomina is under the illusion that she likes picking up different personas, but with every single facade, she becomes bored and uninterested, just like Beauplaisir.</tei-note>
          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#gender2" xml:id="notegender2" id="notegender2">Fantomina notes that men often cut off women with no empathy towards their pain, only selfish feeling for their own purposes, highlighting the actions throughout the story of Beauplaisir leaving Fantomina's different personas.</tei-note>
          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#billet1" xml:id="notebillet1" id="notebillet1">Referring to billet-doux, which is a love letter. In French it directly translates to "sweet letter."</tei-note>
          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#embrio1">Italian version of the word "embryo". Described as the archaic form.</tei-note>
          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#Innocence">Fantomina believes her meddling is "innocent," but also knows other people might view it as otherwise, and recognizes her need for secrecy in the face of the truth that her actions aren't acceptable.</tei-note>
          <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#gender1" xml:id="notegender1" id="notegender1"> This is pretty ignorant of him to say especially in the time that this story takes place. With the context of the rest of the sentence you see that he is upset that she doesn't trust him to keep a secret, but a woman's entire is livlihood at stake when she loses her "virtue" and he is not taking into consideration the privilege he holds by simply being born a man.</tei-note>
            <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#note1" xml:id="ann1" id="ann1">It seems as though Beauplaisir is in genuine suprise upon the calling of his presence by Fantomina; Fantomina's deceit is met with Beauplaisir's sincere reaction of suprise.</tei-note>
            <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#note2" xml:id="ann2" id="ann2">Beauplaisir shows care for Fantomina; unknown whether this is sincere love or what Fantomina's mother describes as "renewing of the crime."</tei-note>
            <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#note3" xml:id="ann3" id="ann3">Fantomina's Mother's anger reaches its climax.</tei-note>
            <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#note4" xml:id="ann4" id="ann4">Fantomina's despair and distress reaches its climax.</tei-note>
            <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#note5" xml:id="ann5" id="ann5">Fantomina's word choice is important as she expresses an important juztaposition of responsibility that although Beauplaisir is a direct cause of her current situation (that being the pregnancy) she absolves him of this in her use of the word "innocent.' </tei-note>
            <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#note6" xml:id="ann6" id="ann6">Fantomina's mother absolves Beauplaisir of his part in Fantomina's "undoing."</tei-note>
            <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#note7" xml:id="ann7" id="ann7">Haywood ends this story with an interesting characterization of Fantomina's story as not being inherently unique and uncommon throughout the history of the world. The sudden end to the story also illustrates a seemingly "happy" ending in the sense that Fantomina is no longer a danger to herself and that she is no longer around to bring shame upon her upper-class family.</tei-note>
            <tei-note data-origname="note" target="#note8" xml:id="ann8" id="ann8">The mystery of Fantomina is now revealed. It is important to note that this point in the text is in fact AFTER the peak intensity of emotions displayed by Fantomina, her mother, and Beauplaisir; not before.</tei-note>
