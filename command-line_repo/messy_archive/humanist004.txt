Four humanities departments at the Univ. of Alberta, Canada (English,
Philosophy, Classics, and Religious Studies) have established a committee to
investigate the possibility of a joint computer lab for faculty and graduate
student research use.  The five person committee has a small budget and one
year to ascertain the needs and desires of those persons for whom the lab is
intended, to view established labs at certain other institutions, and to draft
a formal proposal for funding under a provincial government special initiatives
program.  If the proposal is approved by the cabinet of the Alberta government,
the committee's budget will be renewed for a further twelve months during which
time the proposal would be implemented and the lab established.
 
The committee would welcome any suggestions or news of particular successes
and difficulties which others may have encountered while setting up similar
facilities.  Comments or queries may be sent to the committee through
SREIMER@UALTAVM.BITNET.
