The Center for Computer Analysis of Texts is pleased to announce
the availability of our Graphics library for EGA, CGA and Hercules
displays.  We are willing to provide interested colleagues
with the essential routines to display foreign fonts on
these adapters.  In addition, we will provide you with the following
initial fonts: Arabic, Armenian, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew,
Phonetics, Punic, and Roman.   The routines are written in Turbo
Pascal and Assembler.  We will send you a demonstration program with
including source code.  If you are interested in adding this facility to
already written programs or new ones, you will have to agree to
the following conditions:
 
    1. Not to redistribute the demo disk to others.  Other
       colleagues may receive copies from the Center.
 
    2. To give appropriate scholarly recognition to the
       Center and its staff for this work.
 
    3. To share any developments or resulting programs
       with the University of Pennsylvania at no cost
       and under University License Agreement.
 
If you agree to all these conditions, we will provide you with
the full library and additional documentation.  We will coordinate
updates and share with you any and all improvements.i
In addition, we have an opportunity to organize a small workshop on
Graphics display if there is sufficient interest.
